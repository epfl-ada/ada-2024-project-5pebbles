    "What are the key elements or combinations of elements that contribute to a movie's success?\n",
    "We now possess extensive data on films that allows us to analyze how various attributes or combinations influence box office performance and critical reception. Expected factors include movie metadata such as genre, acting performances, release date, production company, country of origin, and director. Additionally, the film's narrative should be considered, including the number of protagonists, frequency of emotional engagement, and overarching themes. By examining films from different eras, we can determine whether certain elements remain constant or evolve over time, providing insights into changing audience preferences and industry standards. This will help me understand the essential components for creating successful films in today's market.\n",

I want to explore the popularity of various types across different eras, including action, romance, horror, and documentaries. Additionally, the evolution of story themes—such as social issues, personal journeys, and fantastical narratives—and their resonance with audiences at different historical moments is of great interest to me.

    "\n",
    "I also wish to study the evolution of how movie endings are presented. Classic narratives often conclude with a clear resolution, whether tragic or comedic, providing a definitive closure. However, it seems that films with ambiguous endings are becoming more common today. I want to understand how audience attitudes toward these types of endings have shifted. This analysis will encompass films of various genres and time periods, examining the reception of different ending styles across eras, with box office performance and ratings as evaluation criteria. As for methodology, I plan to use text analysis models or related techniques to input movie summaries, identifying and categorizing different types of endings—such as closed, open (ambiguous)—and judging them (e.g., good ending, bad ending, open ending). Next, I will assess the degree to which different narrative closures are accepted by audiences, essentially measuring satisfaction. This exploration will reveal changes in cinematic storytelling techniques and may reflect contemporary audience attitudes towards films, alongside broader societal shifts.\n"

    "\\\\\\\\Idea 3: I love this idea! Its creative and unique, and can tell a compelling data story. One point of concern - feasibility. You say you will categorize endings (good, bad, open) - I currently cannot think of an idea that can do this effectively and precisely. How will you asses the satisfaction, I assume through ratings? If so, you would need an external dataset (IMDB ratings for example, or reviews). The core of the idea is great, however I am afraid that it might be too dificult."
