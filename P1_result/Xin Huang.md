**Idea 1 is excellent, but ideas 2 and 3 are too shallow and can benefit from more exploration.**

 

**\\\\Idea 1: Creative idea. One minor concern about point 7: This seems a bit too ambitous, as how can you determine the effect these actors had on the film industry?** 

Idea 1: "Height, Power, Beauty and Culture: Analyzing the Role of Actor Height in Cinema’s Evolving Standards and Societal Expectations"

A. Overall Goal

This project aims to analyze how actor height reflects evolving standards of beauty, power, and cultural expectations in cinema. By exploring the relationships between height, gender, role types, and genre, it seeks to uncover how societal and cultural shifts have influenced casting decisions and character portrayals over time. The project also investigates how height dynamics in films mirror broader societal trends, including changing gender roles and power dynamics.

B. Research Questions

1. "Height and Changing Beauty Standards"

How have the average heights of male and female actors evolved over the past century? How do these gender-based height differences reflect societal expectations of masculinity and femininity, and how have these expectations evolved over time?

2. "Height and Power Dynamics"

How does height influence the assignment of power roles such as heroes, villains, and sidekicks? Are there specific genres where height plays a more significant role in determining power dynamics? For example, are taller actors more likely to be cast as heroes in superhero films, while shorter actors are cast as cunning villains?

3. "Height Trends by Genre Type"

Are there noticeable differences in height trends in genre-specific casting, such as taller actors being preferred for superhero roles and average-height actors being chosen for romantic comedies?

4. "Height gap between male and female in Cinema"

How have height gap between male and female leads in romantic films evolved over the decades? Has this gap narrowed as gender roles have become more fluid?

5. "Height in different culture"

Do non-Western film industries (e.g., Bollywood, South Korean cinema) have different height preferences compared to Hollywood, and how do these differences reflect local cultural standards of beauty and power?

6. "Cultural Shifts and Height Representation"

How do cultural and societal changes (e.g., the rise of feminism, body positivity movements) impact height preferences in casting?

7. "The Influence of Iconic Actors on Height Trends"

Have iconic actors (e.g., Tom Cruise, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) affected height trends in the film industry?

**\\\\Idea 2: Concrete proposal of how to carry out analysis, however, it lacks creativty, you have to think about how can you extend this to tell an interesting data story.** 

Idea 2: "Character Age Representation and Its Impact on Movie Success"

In this project, I aim to investigate how different age groups are represented in films and analyze whether the age of characters and actors has any impact on a movie’s box office success. I will utilize the “character.metadata.tsv" file, which provides detailed information on the actors' ages and the movies they were part of, along with the "movie.metadata.tsv" file for box office data.

**\\ \\Idea 3: Same as Idea 2.**

Idea 3: "Evolution of Movie Genres Over a Century"

For this project, I plan to analyze the evolution of movie genres over the last century, specifically focusing on how genre popularity has shifted over time and in response to historical events. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations by examining the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset, which includes genre and release date information for over 42,000 movies.
