Super interesting and creative ideas, especially 1 and 2. Idea 3 could benefit from some further exploration of the data available.

# Idea1 Golden partners between the directors and the actors
It’s quite common to see certain directors repeatedly collaborate with the same actors or actresses across multiple films. For instance, Cillian Murphy has featured in 6 different movies directed by Christopher Nolan. It would be interesting to explore these relationships and investigate whether there’s a particular "chemistry" that contributes to their success. We can explore this through following aspect: 
(1) Analyze the preferences of directors. Who are their favored actors/actresses? Do they show preferences based on factors like age, nationality, or other characteristics? 
(2) From the actors’/actresses’ perspective, who are their favored directors, and what are their preferences? 
(3) Does this kind of partnership contribute to a film's success? (4) Who are the "golden partners" between directors and actors

Excellent! One minor concern: You should have explored the dataset you can use for this analysis. Overall, detailed and creative idea with clear focus and goal in mind.

# Idea2: Actors & Astrology: Zodiac Trends in Movie Field
Astrology is an ancient practice used to predict the present and future by observing the movements of celestial bodies. While this method is now regarded as lacking scientific validity, many still believe that individuals born under different zodiac signs have distinct personality traits. This project aims to investigate whether there are any zodiac-related trends in the film industry. Here are some main questions of this project:
(1)Is the distribution of actors born under each zodiac sign even? Which zodiac sign has the highest representation among actors?
(2)Do actors of different zodiac signs tend to prefer certain genres of movies?
(3)Are such distributions and tendencies influenced by factors such as the actor's gender, nationality or any other demographics?

Again, super creative unique idea! Proposal is clear, and with concrete path and steps needed to be taken. Might benefit some extension in the future.

# Idea3: Cinematic Landscapes: Regional Differences in Film
Audiences from different cultural backgrounds often have varying preferences in movies. For example, the highest-rated film directed by Christopher Nolan on IMDb is The Dark Knight. However, on Douban, the most popular movie rating platform in China, The Dark Knight ranks fourth, while Interstellar takes the top spot. This project aims to explore regional differences in film preferences. We can focus on the following aspects: 
 (1) Do different regions show variations in their choice of film genres?
 (2) Do actors/actresses from different regions prefer starring in certain types of movies? Are these preferences influenced by gender?
 (3) Are there regional differences in box office revenue and movie ratings?
 (4) What might be the latent reason cause this variations? 
Note: The third question may require additional data on regional box office revenue and movie ratings.

 Interesting idea. What worries me here is the data; you might need data from different platforms, if unavailable, this can take a lot of time.
